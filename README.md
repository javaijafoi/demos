## 3D Fate Dice

The file `fate-dice-3d.html` loads Three.js, OrbitControls and GSAP from the `libs/` folder so it works even without CDNs. Serve the repo over HTTP (e.g. via GitHub Pages) to roll the dice in 3D.

## Dice Roller V2

The file `dice-roller-v2.html` provides an improved dark-theme interface for rolling polyhedral dice. Click the plus/minus buttons on each die type to set quantities and press **Rolar** to see the results.
