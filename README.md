## 3D Fate Dice

The file `fate-dice-3d.html` loads Three.js, OrbitControls and GSAP from the `libs/` folder so it works even without CDNs. Serve the repo over HTTP (e.g. via GitHub Pages) to roll the dice in 3D.

## Dice Roller V2

The file `dice-roller-v2.html` provides an improved dark-theme interface for rolling polyhedral dice. Click the plus/minus buttons on each die type to set quantities and press **Rolar** to see the results.

## Dice Roller V4

The file `dice-roller-v4.html` adds per-die color customization with a modern neon look. Click the plus button to add a die with the chosen color, then roll to see each die displayed in its own color.

## Galaxy Dice Roller

`galaxy-roller.html` showcases a wild new interface where dice icons orbit the screen. Click to add dice, long press to change the default color and roll to see colorful results. Each die keeps its own color chip for quick tweaking.

## Vamp01 Roller

`vamp01.html` implements a dark themed dice roller for *Vampiro: A MÃ¡scara* with quick action buttons, difficulty slider, success and bestial failure tracking, and a collapsible history panel.
